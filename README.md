# Astrum-Wallet

Technical aspects of Astrum Wallet

The name Astrum alludes to stars and comes from the name of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, final destination for the hikers and pilgrims. Compostela means 'field of stars'.

Astrum is a closed loop micropayment wallet, meaning that it can only be used to pay at merchants and establishments with an Astrum Wallet account offering services on any of the recognized Roads to Santiago. The 10,000+ businesses are primarily located in Spain and Portugal. 

There are three main functions for the Astrum Wallet:

Merchants and service providers can accept payment with the Astrum Wallet virtually eliminating credit card merchant fees. 
Hikers and pilgrims can make micropayments for services on the Road to Santiago with their smartphone. Users will save on ATM fees and credit card charges. They will also reduce the risk of losing cash through theft. 
Users will have the ability to book and pay for accommodation with participating hostels and small hotels. The use of the Astrum Wallet will reduce the commissions paid by accommodation providers by almost 80%. 

How it works for merchant:

All merchants and service providers must have a valid account with Astrum. 

Merchants pay a one-time admin fee to cover the purchase of 10 XRP.

They do not need to actually buy any XRP. Astrum will stake the 10 XRP on their behalf in order to activate the wallet. Once activated they can begin to accept payment in ASTRUM, a proprietary Euro based stable token.

ASTRUM will be backed 100% by fiat in Euros deposited by users. 

Merchants will have access to an agile off-ramp for withdrawing ASTRUM as Euros for deposit in their fiat bank account. 

User will fund their wallet by transferring Euros to the fiat account of Astrum with Banco Santander in Spain. Banco Santander offers low-cost, almost instantaneous international wire transfer in collaboration with Ripple. 

Astrum will follow all KYC guidelines to avoid any issues with money laundering. Users and merchants will need to upload copies of the required documents and personal or corporate identification.

This funds will be held in an escrow account to back ASTRUM, a Euro based stable token. 

Participating merchants enter the cost of the service provided in the wallet and the user validates the transaction by tapping the merchants phone with their smartphone. The funds are instantly transferred on the XRP Ledger. 

Users will be able to review transactions or top up their balance at any time. 

Just as with merchant accounts, user are not required to purchase XRP since Astrum will send 10 XRP when the wallet is opened in order to activate the account. When the user no longer requires the wallet. For instance, they have completed the Road to Santiago and have no intention of returning, the account will be closed. 2 XRP will be burned for transaction fees and 8 XRP will accrue to the Astrum treasury. 

With an expected 200,000 users by 2025, Astrum will retain more than 1.6 million XRP annually. 

It is expected that merchant accounts will last several years and the XRP sent to activate each wallet will remain to cover network fees for the medium term. 

The fees charged by Astrum for each transaction will remain very low by design. Neither merchants nor users will actually see transaction fees in their wallets. 

The average user on the Camino will make between 8 and 10 micropayments per day for an average of 15 days. This amounts to a maximum of 150 transactions. A negligible amount of transaction fees. 

Both users and merchants will save credit card fees by using the Astrum Wallet. With no need to carry cash, users will also save on ATM charges and currency exchange fees.

Users who have a balance in the wallet at the end of their journey may elect to donate it to a project in support of the Camino or as a tip to a specific hostel or service provider. 

Users requesting a refund in fiat will need to pay an administration fee to cover the cost of the international transfer. 

#Reservations

The informal system for booking accommodation has never kept pace with the increased popularity of the Camino. Especially during the summer months or on important holidays, such as Easter. 

Increasingly, users have turned to apps such as booking.com to make confirmed reservations. These services also help when language is an issue. The problem is that the commissions charged by these apps represent a serious drain on operating margins for small businesses. By their very nature, the reservation also demands a credit card transaction with the associated fees. 

Guaranteed reservations can be a problem for hikers with these apps. Inclement weather or injuries may mean that the user can't arrive but ends up paying regardless. 

The Astrum Wallet offers an elegant solution leveraging the escrow function of XRPL. Users can make a tentative reservation that has a condition based on time. If they don't arrive at the establishment at the agreed time. The reservation is automatically cancelled and the funds returned to the wallet of the user. 

In the case that the user arrives at the hostel before the set time and checks in, the condition is considered met and the funds are transferred to the establishment.

If the condition expires, the transaction is cancelled and the establishment can put the bed or room back into inventory. 

In peak season, the user can make a confirmed reservation and the funds are transferred immediately. Astrum will charge 0.25 euro to the merchant and 0.25 euro to the user for each reservation. A minimum 80% savings for the merchant, not including credit card fees. 

Merchants will receive a push notification to alert of a reservation request that they must confirm or deny. Users will also receive a push notification when a reservation is accepted along with any conditions. 

Both users and merchants can review transactions in the wallet. 

We hope to have 50% of merchants and service providers (5000+) on the app by 2025, rising to 75% (7500) by 2027.

Of the estimated 500,000 users on the Camino in 2025. We expect to have 200,000 funded wallets in 2025 with 350,000 by 2027. 

By 2025, the average hiker or pilgrim will spend 80 euros per day over 15 days. With 200,000 users, we expect total transactions of 240 million euros. In 2025, we anticipate revenue of almost 1 million euros in booking fees and 1.6 million accrued XRP after the wallets close. All transaction fees will go to operating costs. 

By not requiring merchants or users to acquire XRP (instead Astrum stakes the 10 XRP to activate each wallet), we remove one of the most significant barriers to adoption of the Astrum Wallet. 

Additional services offered with the Astrum Wallet will include the ability of merchants to send push notifications to hikers based on geographical location. Merchants can purchase push notifications at a significant savings over similar services on Facebook or Google. 

For example, a restaurant may have empty tables so they decide to broadcast a special menu price to everyone on the app within 5 kms. Users who accept the offer will have the cost of the meal held in escrow until they arrive at the restaurant and validate the transaction. 

Although we have elected to begin with Astrum on the Road to Santiago, we anticipate ever expanding acceptance wherever a closed loop wallet makes sense. A selection of wineries in Spain may offer a discount on tastings or for ordering their wines at participating restaurants. 

An association of charming rural hotels may be able to capture more clients by offering a discount based on a set number of nights. The savings on commissions will allow the establishments to offer a more attractive price. 

The wallet can also be used as a tourist passport in order to steer tourist to specific restaurants, bars, attractions or hotels in highly competitive areas such as Barcelona, Mallorca or Madrid. 

Regional tourist boards can make a plan to combat seasonality, using a, special offer on Astrum Wallet to extend shoulder seasons or mid-week bookings. 

The successful adoption of the Astrum Wallet on the Road to Santiago will have an impact much further than Spain and Portugal. The hikers and pilgrims come from dozens of countries with Australia, Brazil. Italy, Germany, Korea, Canada and the United States contributing ever increasing numbers of travelers. 

These users will take their experience with the Astrum Wallet back with them to their own country, speeding acceptance and adoption. We call this the ripple effect. 

If this project receives funding ($25,000), the money will be used entirely to develop the prototype of the Astrum Wallet using the XUMM SDK.
